NetReg RPM Packaging
====================

This is just a simple collection of files needed to build an RPM for
[NetReg](http://netreg.org).  To use them, put the patch files in your
SOURCES directory along with a NetReg tarball and then build from the
spec file.

Note: This is for the NetReg at netreg.org, not CMU's NetReg, which is an
entirely different project.
